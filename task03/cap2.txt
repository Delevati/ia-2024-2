You are an expert in artificial intelligence and have read Chapter 2 (“Intelligent Agents”) of Stuart Russell & Peter Norvig’s Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (4th ed.). Please produce a concise, structured summary that covers every key concept, definition, classification and example presented in that chapter, explicitly including:

1. The formal definition of an agent:
   - Agent as a mapping from percept sequences to actions (f: P*→A)
   - The architecture of sensors and actuators
2. The notion of rationality:
   - Rational agent versus omniscient, perfect performance, and bounded rationality
   - The performance measure Perf: H→ℝ over percept histories H
   - Role of prior knowledge and percept sequence
3. The agent function and agent program distinction
4. The five classes of agent programs:
   - Simple reflex agents
   - Model-based reflex agents
   - Goal-based agents
   - Utility-based agents
   - Learning agents
5. The concept of a state:
   - Internal state versus world state
   - How model-based agents maintain state
6. The performance evaluation framework:
   - Definition and examples of performance measures
   - Trade-offs (e.g. accuracy vs. speed)
7. Properties of environments and their impact on agent design:
   - Observability: fully vs. partially observable
   - Deterministic vs. stochastic
   - Episodic vs. sequential
   - Static vs. dynamic (and semidynamic)
   - Discrete vs. continuous
   - Known vs. unknown
8. Illustrative examples used in the chapter:
   - Vacuum-cleaner world
   - Simple reflex agent rule tables
   - Model-based agent in vacuum-cleaner world
   - Goal formulation example (e.g. path-finding)
   - Utility function example (e.g. buying stock)
   - Learning agent architecture diagram
9. Any accompanying diagrams or figures (describe their content briefly)
10. A brief synthesis of how these definitions and classifications lay the foundation for later chapters on search, planning, and learning

Organize the summary with headings matching the chapter’s structure. Use clear, precise academic language and bullet points where appropriate.
